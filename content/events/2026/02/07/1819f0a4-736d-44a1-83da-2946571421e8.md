## Lugano Neural Networks Workshop

Join the USI Institute of Computing for an immersive day of neural network theory and practice. This workshop bridges the gap between textbook knowledge and real-world implementation.

### Modules

1. **Foundations** — Feedforward networks, backpropagation, optimization
2. **Convolutional Networks** — Image classification and feature extraction
3. **Recurrent Networks** — Sequence modelling and time series
4. **Graph Neural Networks** — Learning on graph-structured data

### Requirements

- Python and PyTorch experience
- Laptop with GPU access (cloud notebooks provided as backup)

Coffee breaks and lunch included. Materials in English.
